## Week 4 Homework for Skill Distillery

## Overview
My week 4 project for Skill Distillery. This was a project on a BlackJack game. This prompts the user to play or quit. If the user decides to play they are given two cards along with the dealer. You then decide based on your card amount if you want to hit or stay. If you are above 21 then you bust then the dealer goes through the same logic.

## Lessons learned
The lessons learned was really learning blackjack and how to try to implement small "easy" knowledge of the game into code. Also trying to figure out how to get the card value to match up with the wining or losing values of the game logic.
